## üéØ Implementation Approach

Each plan follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**:

```
1. Write failing test ‚ùå
2. Run test to confirm failure
3. Write minimal implementation
4. Run test to confirm pass ‚úÖ
5. Commit (small, focused)
6. Repeat
```

**Bite-sized tasks:** Each task is 2-5 minutes of focused work with automated checkpoints.

**Code review gates:** Codacy integration requires analysis after every file edit (per cursor rules).

## üöÄ How to Use These Plans

### For Single Engineer
```
1. Read docs/plans/README.md (10 min)
2. Read IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (10 min)
3. Open docs/plans/2025-10-23-phase0-*.md
4. Use executing-plans skill in Claude Code
5. Follow tasks sequentially with code review between each
```

### For Multiple Engineers
```
1. All read docs/plans/README.md
2. Phase 0-1: Sequential (foundation must be solid)
3. Phase 2: Parallel clone implementation (5 clones independent)
4. Phase 3: Sequential deployment (order matters)
```

### For Code Review
```
1. Verify all tests pass (npm test)
2. Check coverage >90% (npm run test:coverage)
3. Confirm Codacy analysis run (per cursor rules)
4. Validate NO SIMULATIONS LAW not violated
5. Check commit follows TDD pattern
```
