## 🎯 What You're Building

**VoidCat-DSN v2.0** - A distributed AI coordination system with:

- 5 specialized Claude AI clones (Omega, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Sigma)
- Real AI execution via Anthropic API (NO SIMULATIONS LAW)
- Docker containerization with health monitoring
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration
- Complete audit trails and evidence collection
- 159+ tests with >90% code coverage

## 📋 Implementation Plans Overview

| Phase | Duration | Tasks | What You Build |
|-------|----------|-------|----------------|
| **0** | 8-12h | 5 | IntegrityMonitor, EvidenceCollector, AutoGenClient, TestFramework |
| **1** | 8-12h | 5 | ArtifactManager, ContextEngineer, RyuzuClone base class |
| **2** | 16-20h | 9 | All 5 clones + HTTP servers + inter-clone communication |
| **3** | 12-16h | 8 | Docker, docker-compose, MCP server, deployment scripts |
| **Total** | 44-60h | 27 | Complete distributed AI system |

## 🚀 Execution Options

### Option 1: Single Engineer, Sequential (Recommended for Learning)
```
Time: 44-60 hours over 2-3 weeks
Phase 0 → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3
One task at a time, full code review between tasks
```

### Option 2: Team, Parallel (Fast)
```
Time: 15-20 hours with multiple engineers
Phases 0-1: Sequential (foundation first)
Phase 2: Parallel (5 clones can be built concurrently)
Phase 3: Sequential (deployment order matters)
```

### Option 3: Use executing-plans Skill
```
Launch Claude Code's executing-plans skill
Implement one task per execution
Automatic code review between tasks
Perfect for solo development
```

## ✅ Pre-Implementation Checklist

Before you start implementing:

- [ ] Node.js 18+ installed (`node --version`)
- [ ] npm installed (`npm --version`)
- [ ] Anthropic API key ready (`echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)
- [ ] Ports 3000-3005 available (or change in docker-compose)
- [ ] Docker installed (optional, needed for Phase 3)
- [ ] Workspace directory created: `mkdir -p workspace/{artifacts,manifests,audit,temp}`

## 🏃 Getting Started Now

### Next 30 Minutes
1. Read CLAUDE.md (5 min)
2. Read IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md (10 min)
3. Read docs/plans/README.md (15 min)

### Next Hour
1. Set up environment (Node.js, API key)
2. Run `npm install`
3. Create workspace directories

### Next Session
1. Choose execution approach
2. Open `docs/plans/2025-10-23-phase0-integrity-foundation.md`

## 💡 Key Concepts

**NO SIMULATIONS LAW**
- Every AI query uses the real Anthropic API
- Zero mock responses or fallback simulations
- Enforced in all code and tests

**Test-First Development**
- Write failing test first (red)
- Implement minimal code (green)
- All code examples provided
- Run tests after each change

**Bite-Sized Tasks**
- Each task is 2-5 minutes
- Clear test → implementation → commit flow
- Frequent small commits
- Easy to review and understand

**Evidence Collection**
- Every operation tracked
- Audit trails for everything
- Integrity verification built-in
- Complete traceability
