---

## Implementation Workflow

### Quick Start

**Option 1: Step-by-Step Execution (Recommended)**

Use the executing-plans skill to implement one task at a time with automatic code review between tasks:

```bash
# Start in a dedicated git worktree
git worktree add voidcat-implementation

# Run plans sequentially
# Each plan has automated code review gates
```

**Option 2: Parallel Implementation**

Launch fresh subagents for independent tasks with code review checkpoints.

---

## Key Principles

### NO SIMULATIONS LAW
- 100% real AI execution via Anthropic API
- Zero mock responses or fallback simulations
- Evidence-based execution tracking

### Integrity-First Architecture
- Every component includes verification from inception
- SHA-256 checksums for artifact integrity
- Chain checksums for audit trail tampering detection

### Artifact-Centric Workflow
- Version-controlled work products
- Comprehensive metadata and manifests
- Reproducible, auditable operations

### Test-First Development
- 159+ tests across all components
- Evidence collection built into test framework
- >90% code coverage targets

### Bite-Sized Task Granularity
- Each task is 2-5 minutes of focused work
- TDD: Write test → Run failing test → Implement → Run passing test → Commit
- Frequent small commits vs. large monolithic changes

---

## Estimated Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Tasks | Effort |
|-------|----------|-------|--------|
| Phase 0 | Week 1-2 | 5 | 8-12h |
| Phase 1 | Week 3-4 | 5 | 8-12h |
| Phase 2 | Week 5-6 | 9 | 16-20h |
| Phase 3 | Week 7-9 | 8 | 12-16h |
| **Total** | **9 weeks** | **27** | **44-60h** |

---

## Testing Strategy

Each plan includes:

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing with >90% coverage
2. **Integration Tests** - Cross-component and inter-clone communication
3. **E2E Tests** - Full workflow and deployment verification
4. **Evidence Collection** - Audit trails for all operations

Run tests:

```bash
npm test                    # All tests with coverage
npm run test:unit          # Unit tests only
npm run test:integration   # Integration tests
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end tests
npm run test:coverage     # Coverage report
```

---

## Code Quality Gates

### Codacy Integration

After **every file edit**, the Codacy MCP tool must be run:

```bash
# After editing src/clones/beta/index.js
codacy_cli_analyze --rootPath /path/to/repo --file src/clones/beta/index.js
```

### Coverage Requirements

- Core modules: >90% coverage
- Overall pass rate: 95%+
- No uncovered critical paths

### NO SIMULATIONS LAW Verification

Every phase includes explicit tests that:
- Reject mock queries with `NO SIMULATIONS LAW VIOLATION`
- Enforce AutoGen real execution
- Verify audit trail integrity

---

## Execution Tips

### For Engineers New to Codebase

1. **Read CLAUDE.md first** - Architecture overview and common commands
2. **Start with Phase 0** - Foundational components set context
3. **Reference plan.md** - Full architectural blueprint for deep dives
4. **Follow TDD strictly** - Write test before implementation

### For Code Reviewers

- Verify test coverage is >90% for new code
- Confirm NO SIMULATIONS LAW isn't violated
- Check that Codacy analysis was run and issues addressed
- Validate commits follow TDD pattern: test → implementation → commit

### Debugging Failed Tasks

1. Run the failing test in isolation:
   ```bash
   npm test -- test/path/to/test.js --grep "test name"
   ```

2. Check error messages for:
   - Missing dependencies (install with `npm install`)
   - Port conflicts (verify ports 3000-3005 available)
   - API key issues (set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var)

3. Review audit trail:
   ```bash
   cat workspace/audit/*.json
   ```

## Getting Help

### If a Task is Blocked

1. Check the test output for specific error messages
2. Review workspace audit logs for previous operations
3. Verify prerequisites (API key, ports, dependencies)
4. Re-read the task description for missed steps

### For Questions About Architecture

- Reference **plan.md** for comprehensive design documentation
- Check **CLAUDE.md** for common development patterns
- Review existing test files for usage examples

### For Integration Issues

- Run health checks: `npm run health-check`
- Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs -f`
- Verify artifact integrity: Check `workspace/artifacts/` directory
