# Phase 2 Completion Evidence

Date: 2025-10-23

This document provides real, verifiable evidence that Phase 2 (Clone Specialization) is complete per the architecture and plan.

## âœ… Scope Delivered

- Beta (Analyzer) clone implemented and tested
- Gamma (Architect) clone implemented and tested
- Delta (Tester) clone implemented and tested
- Sigma (Communicator) clone implemented and tested
- Omega (Coordinator) clone implemented and tested
- HTTP endpoints for all clones: /health, /task, specialization endpoints, artifacts store/retrieve
- NO SIMULATIONS LAW enforced across all operations (execution: "real" evidence, real checksums)
- End-to-end orchestration validated (Omega -> Beta)

## ðŸ”¬ Test Results (Real Execution)

- Command executed: npm test
- Environment: Node v22.x, npm 10.x (Windows PowerShell)
- Result: 254 passing, 0 failing

Selected output excerpt:

```text
254 passing (7s)
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Coverage Summary (from latest run)

- All files: Statements 95.09%, Branches 86.55%, Functions 98.78%, Lines 95.09%
- Clones overall above 87% statements; overall project >90% statements

Table excerpt:

```text
All files                  |   95.09 |    86.55 |   98.78 |   95.09
clones/omega/OmegaClone.js |   87.46 |    71.42 |  100.00 |   87.46
```

## ðŸ§ª Tests Added in Phase 2

- Unit tests
  - `test/unit/clones/delta/test-delta-clone.test.js`
  - `test/unit/clones/sigma/test-sigma-clone.test.js`
  - `test/unit/clones/omega/test-omega-clone.test.js`
- Integration tests
  - `test/integration/orchestration-success.test.js` (Omega orchestrates to live Beta)

All tests assert real evidence markers and real SHA-256 checksums (no mocks).

## ðŸ”— Key Files and Endpoints

- Beta: `src/clones/beta/BetaClone.js` â†’ /health, /task, /analyze, /artifacts, /artifacts/:id
- Gamma: `src/clones/gamma/GammaClone.js` â†’ /health, /task, /design, /artifacts, /artifacts/:id
- Delta: `src/clones/delta/DeltaClone.js` â†’ /health, /task, /generate-tests, /artifacts, /artifacts/:id
- Sigma: `src/clones/sigma/SigmaClone.js` â†’ /health, /task, /document, /artifacts, /artifacts/:id
- Omega: `src/clones/omega/OmegaClone.js` â†’ /health, /task, /orchestrate, /delegate, /network-status, artifacts endpoints

## ðŸ”’ NO SIMULATIONS LAW Compliance

- AutoGenClient always marks execution: "real"; failures recorded as "failed" with no mock fallback
- EvidenceCollector logs every AI execution, artifact operation, and orchestration step
- ArtifactManager stores artifacts with real SHA-256 checksums and verifies on retrieval
- Integration test uses live HTTP between Omega and Beta; no stubs/mocks used

## ðŸŽ¯ Acceptance Checklist Mapping

- [x] Beta implemented + tested
- [x] Gamma implemented + tested
- [x] Delta implemented + tested
- [x] Sigma implemented + tested
- [x] Omega implemented + tested
- [x] Express routes for all clones
- [x] All clone tests passing
- [x] Integration orchestration test passing
- [x] Overall coverage >90%
- [ ] Optional: CloneServer factory (not required; equivalent per-clone Express servers implemented)
- [ ] Optional: SanctuaryMessageProtocol (Omega uses direct HTTP orchestration with axios)

Rationale: The planâ€™s optional items are functionally covered by the current architecture (per-clone HTTP servers and Omega coordination). Introducing additional abstractions is not required to meet Phase 2 goals and would increase risk without added value at this stage.

## ðŸ“œ Audit Evidence

- Evidence logs written by EvidenceCollector under workspace audit directory
- Real timestamps and taskIds in orchestration records
- Real checksums visible in artifact manifests

Signed-off: Automated verification via npm test and coverage in this repository. Real outputs only, per NO SIMULATIONS LAW.
