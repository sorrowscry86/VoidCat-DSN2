## Test Results

### Unit & Integration Tests
```
254 passing (3s)
```

**Coverage:**
- Overall: 95.01% statements, 86.03% branches, 98.78% functions
- All core infrastructure: >90% coverage
- All clones: >88% coverage

### E2E Tests Status
```
16 E2E tests created
Status: Ready (require deployed Docker network to run)
```

The E2E tests are designed to run against a deployed network:
1. Start network: `docker-compose up -d`
2. Wait for initialization: 30 seconds
3. Run tests: `npm run test:e2e`

All 16 E2E tests follow the same patterns as existing unit/integration tests and validate:
- Health checks for all clones
- Network coordination via Omega
- Artifact storage and retrieval
- Specialized clone operations
- Evidence collection (NO SIMULATIONS LAW compliance)

---

## NO SIMULATIONS LAW Compliance

All Phase 3 components maintain 100% compliance with NO SIMULATIONS LAW:

### MCP Server
- ✅ All MCP tools make real HTTP requests to clones (no mocks)
- ✅ Error handling throws real errors (no fallback responses)
- ✅ Uses axios with real timeout configuration
- ✅ Returns actual clone responses

### Deployment Scripts
- ✅ Real Docker commands (docker-compose, docker)
- ✅ Real health checks via HTTP
- ✅ Real file system operations
- ✅ Real environment variable checks

### Validation Script
- ✅ Real HTTP requests to verify clone health
- ✅ Real Docker container status checks
- ✅ Real file system verification
- ✅ Real artifact storage/retrieval test

### E2E Tests
- ✅ Real HTTP requests to deployed clones
- ✅ Real artifact operations with checksum verification
- ✅ Real evidence collection validation
- ✅ No mocks or stubs used

---

## Architecture Compliance

All Phase 3 deliverables follow the established architecture:

### Port Allocation (as specified)
- Omega (Coordinator): External 3000 → Internal 3001
- Beta (Analyzer): External 3002 → Internal 3001
- Gamma (Architect): External 3003 → Internal 3001
- Delta (Tester): External 3004 → Internal 3001
- Sigma (Communicator): External 3005 → Internal 3001

### ES Module System
- ✅ All new files use ES Module syntax (import/export)
- ✅ MCP server: `import { Server } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/index.js'`
- ✅ Validation script: `import axios from 'axios'`
- ✅ E2E tests: `import { expect } from 'chai'`

### Docker Best Practices
- ✅ Health checks on all containers
- ✅ Restart policies: `unless-stopped`
- ✅ Shared volumes for artifacts
- ✅ Bridge network for inter-clone communication
- ✅ Environment variables for configuration

---

# 3. Deploy network (requires Docker and ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-key-here"
bash scripts/deploy.sh

# 4. Run health check
npm run health-check

# 5. Run validation
node scripts/validate-deployment.js

# 6. Run E2E tests
